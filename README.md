## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ cli/            # CLI parsing & command dispatch
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commands/   # Subcommand handlers: install, init
â”œâ”€â”€ dependency/     # Dependency resolution, lockfile generation
â”œâ”€â”€ registry/       # Handles communication with npm registry
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Shared FS and HTTP utilities
â””â”€â”€ main.rs         # Entrypoint
```

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the setup script
3. Build the CLI:
```bash
cargo build
```

## Commands to Implement

| Command  | Description                  |
|----------|------------------------------|
| `init`   | Create package.json          |
| `install`| Install a dependency         |
| `list`   | (future) List installed deps |

---

## Contributing

Work in modules. Each CLI command has its own file.
Start implementing in `install.rs` and `init.rs`!
